Join us at our first Data Hazards workshop to:
- Have an interesting discussion about ethics, and learn more about the different types of ethical issues that can affect data science projects.
- Contribute to improving the Data Hazards framework, which aims to reduce barriers to discussing these wider ethical issues surrounding data science work.
- Help to improve real data science research projects at the University of Bristol.

Everyone is welcome, from data scientists to sociologists: we'd love to learn from as many different viewpoints as possible.

You can sign up [here](https://bristolexppsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_39O98pGfm4Oagaq) where you'll be given information about participating in the project, and asked to fill in the very short online consent form. 
If you have any questions then please [email us](mailto:grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk)
