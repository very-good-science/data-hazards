# Collecting Feedback

Finally, at the end of the session we would love to get your feedback, and you might want to get feedback from your audience!


## Getting feedback

It can be helpful to ask you attendees to give you feedback after a workshop to see if they found it useful. 
Google or Microsoft Forms tend to work well and are easy to set up!

## Getting feedback on the Data Hazard labels

We would love if the workshops resulted in new people sharing feedback on the labels. 
Please invite attendees to email us or join one of our 'Discussions' on the GitHub page if they'd like to share their feedback with us.
