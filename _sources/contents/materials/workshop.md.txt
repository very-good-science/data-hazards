# Workshop

The Data Hazards were originally designed around a workshop format. 
This was to allow a series of _Project Owners_ to present a research project to _Audience Members_, who would give them feedback on the ethics of their project. 
This could be in any context, like a team meeting, a seminar or a scoping exercise.

<!-- ```{admonition} Upcoming workshops
We are currently planning facilitator training for running Data Hazards workshops to take place in June 2022.
If you are interested in taking part please [email us](grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk)! 

We also plan to run another workshop in June 2022, so keep an eye on our [Events page](events) if you would like to take part.
``` -->

The idea of this was to allow people who were outsiders to the project to give the project owners a new perspective on what the concerns might be. 
This would be guided by a discussion of the Data Hazards, facilitated by a dediated facilitator to make sure that the conversation goes smoothly, and adheres to the [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct).

The image below is a prompt which gives an idea of the kinds of prompts the facilitators might make, and that the Data Hazards are designed to encourage.
