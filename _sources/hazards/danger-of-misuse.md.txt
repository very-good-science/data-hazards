## Description

There is a danger of misusing the algorithm, technology, or data collected as part of this work.

## Examples

__Example 1:__ Using statistical methods to do impossible tasks, like predicting future human behaviour.

__Example 2:__ The collection of a large data set about identifiable individuals, which could be hacked, or used for purposes other than what it was collected for.

__Example 3:__ Misinterpreting statistical methods or failing to appreciate their limitations, for example assuming that psychometrics will accurately or definitively predict future human behaviour.

## Safety Precautions

- Write clear instructions about in what circumstances the algorithm/technology will work or give valid answers and present these wherever the work is presented.
- If work is piloted outside of its original context, it must be re-tested.
- Follow data governance guidelines.
