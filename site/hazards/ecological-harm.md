## Description

This technology has the potential to cause broad ecological harm, even if used correctly.

## Examples

__Example 1:__ Gene drives used to cause extinction events and in situ engineering of microbiomes.

## Safety Precautions

Ensure sufficient physical containment to avoid unexpected release and barriers in place if deployed.
