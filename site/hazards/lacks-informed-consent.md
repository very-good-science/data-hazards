## Description

This hazard applies to datasets or algorithms that use data which has not been provided with the explicit consent of the data owner/creator. This data often lacks
other contextual information which can also make it difficult to understand how the dataset may be biased.


## Examples

__Example 1:__ Large public social media datasets rarely collect informed consent from 'participants'. 

__Example 2:__ [Data linkage projects](https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-015-0070-4) tend not to involve informed consent. 


## Safety Precautions

- Being clear about the limitations of any ground truth inferences made from the data.
- Systems built solely with this type of data should not be applied in practice.
